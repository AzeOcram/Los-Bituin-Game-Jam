Lawrence (Partner): [speed=0.6]Got a call an hour ago — local artist, mid-40s, found in his apartment with his throat slit. Neighbor reported hearing a loud crash around midnight.
You: Any sign of forced entry?
Lawrence (Partner): [speed=0.8]None. The door was locked from the inside… but the place looks like a hurricane tore through it.
You: [i] Alright... let’s take a look. [/i]
